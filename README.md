# NodeWeb
A General Purpose HTML5 Canvas Node Graph Editor.

At the moment I'm still building the basic functionality. The end goal is to be able to output scripts for various platforms. It's almost 2021 and we still have to code a lot of stuff on the web. 

There's so many cool things that are closed off to people who don't want to learn how to code, or perhaps they just aren't wired for it. With this hopefully it can open the door to many possibilities for people like HTML5 games, frontend scripts, backend scripts, serverside scripts, arduino even.. and more using Unreal style blueprints, **but for the web!**

## Here's some previews currently.

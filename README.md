# NodeWeb
A General Purpose HTML5 Canvas Node Graph Editor.

At the moment I'm still building the basic functionality. The end goal is to be able to output scripts for various platforms. It's almost 2021 and we still have to code a lot of stuff, there's so many cool things that are closed off to people who don;t want to learn how to code. With this hopefully it can open the door to HTML5 games, serverside scripts, arduino and more using Unreal style blueprints, but for the web!

Here's some previews currently.
